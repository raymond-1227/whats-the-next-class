# what's the next class
What's the next class? Stop asking me, just take a glance!

## About
I made this project since I have been really annoyed by the school class table website, although according to the software it is being kept up-to-date, but the developer of the system didn't even try to bother making the UI/UX better but rather keeping the 90s web design look.

This is just one thing, the main reason is still the fact that class table completely changes on every new semester, meaning I would have to look at the horribly-designed school class table, especially that the text would be around 1px on phone since... like I said, they never updated the design, therefore RWD is never implemented. Also it takes too much time to find the specific class for the day, so instead, I made my own version that only displays your current/previous and next class at once.

## How To Use
If you have a different class table to import with, you can try modifying the class names for each day **in the exact order**, and if your class has a different time or even longer periods, it's on your own now, good luck adding support to your class table...

## Future Plans
- Multi language support
